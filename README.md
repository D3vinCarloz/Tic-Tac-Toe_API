Project Description
Quiz Tac Toe is a modern web game that combines classic Tic-Tac-Toe with a trivia challenge. Players must correctly answer a multiple-choice question to place their mark on the board. The game's visual theme dynamically changes based on the real-time weather of a selected location, featuring animated backgrounds for day, night, and various weather conditions like rain, clouds, and sun.

Project Files
The project is built with three essential files:

index.html: The main file containing the structure of the game board, modals, and info panels.

style.css: The stylesheet that controls the entire visual experience, including the responsive layout, glassy UI, and all weather animations.

script.js: The core logic of the game, handling everything from player turns and trivia questions to weather data fetching and win conditions.

APIs Used
This project relies on two free external APIs:

OpenWeatherMap API: Used to fetch real-time weather data to power the dynamic, animated backgrounds.

Open Trivia Database API: Used to source the multiple-choice questions for the quiz component of the game.
